Hello!

I added the damage_player.lua file here what contains the fixed player handler on the serverside!

You can add answers and questions into the npc_c file HelpMessages and AnswerMessages.

You can change the answerPed or the helperPed location on the first 2 line.
The shooter NPC-s are on serverside so u can change the position or the skin there.

I hope you like it!
